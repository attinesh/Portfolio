		<p> I am a Post-doctoral research associate at the department of Aerospace & Mechanical Engineering (AME) at the Univeristy of Arizona. My primary research work focuses on:
			<ol>
				<li>How structural motion of airfoils caused by unsteady loading affects transition from laminar to turbulent flow at low flight Reynolds numbers</li>
				<li>Understanding hypersonic transition in the presence of shock boundary layer interaction</li>
			</ol>  
		
		 I study subsonic transition physics through flight testing (on an instrumented scaled model X-56 aircraft) and using experimental methods such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), Schlieren flow visualization, hot wire anemometry, pressure measurements etc in a large (3 ft x 4 ft x 12 ft) subsonic wind tunnel.
		 
		 My reserach on hypersonic tansition is done in a Mach 5 Ludwig tube (at Reynolds number of upto 20 million per meter) facility and an in-draft supersonic tunnel. I employ high frequency pressure transducers and high-speed imagining techniques. 
		 
		 I'm also interested in using Linear Stability Theory (LST) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to complement my experimental work.</p>
