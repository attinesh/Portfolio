		<p> I am a Ph.D.student in Aerospace Engineering at the Univeristy of Arizona. My primary research focus is on nanosecond dielectric barrier discharge (ns-DBD) plasma actuators for flow control. 
		I study the flow physics of these devices through experimental methods such as Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), Schlieren flow visualization, hot wire anemometry and wake rake measurements. I also
		model the effect of actuation using Linear Stability Theory (LST) and the baseline flow behavior using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).</p>
